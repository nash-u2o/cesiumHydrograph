List of Cesium things to try out:
- Transition points representing lakes/reservoirs to polygons (I'll be sending polygons along with this) *DONE*
	- Look into transforming these polygons to 3D (maybe only at a certain zoom level ) where size determines the height of the 3D polygon -- USE THE HEIGHT PROPERTY --
- Displaying different shapes (circles, squares, triangles) representing reservoir locations depending on lake type -- POINT, BOX, POLYGON **KIND OF DONE
- Look into ways to draw polygons, poly lines, points onto the map using Cesiumâ€™s equivalent of the draw interaction in OpenLayers
- 	Look into multi-selection of entities by drawing a box around multiple interested entities
- Look into formats of 3D objects that Cesium uses
- Look into getting rid of parts of the map default UI elements, such as:
- 	Double click interaction on entity that focuses on point
