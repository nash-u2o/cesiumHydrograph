# cesiumHydrograph
The author of this project is Nash Euto

This is a project that was originally made in gitlab and used large files. This code probably will not run when downloaded because of file issues, but the
important file to showcase my work, main.js, is completely updated

Made using Tethys Platform. This was made as a demo for the Cesium mapping API while I was working in ERDC-CHL-HSB (Engineer Research and Development Center - Coastal and Hydraulics Lab - Hydrologics Systems Branch)

To see the javascript code which was the majority of the work I did, look in tethysapp/cesiumproject/public/js for main.js
