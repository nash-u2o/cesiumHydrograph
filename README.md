# cesiumHydrograph
Made using Tethys Platform. This was made as a demo for the Cesium mapping API while I was working in ERDC-CHL-HSB (Engineer Research and Development Center - Coastal and Hydraulics Lab - Hydrologics Systems Branch)

To see the javascript code which was the majority of the work I did, look in tethysapp/cesiumproject/public/js for main.js
